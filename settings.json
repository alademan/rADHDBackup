If something is missing you can [message the moderators](/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FADHD) to notify us or request permissions to help expand the wiki.  \n2. **[Search /r/adhd](/r/ADHD/search?q=adhd+keywords&restrict_sr=on) for previous posts** on the topic ([search via google](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com%2Fr%2Fadhd+adderall)).  \n3. **Use a specific, meaningful title.**  Incomplete or vague post titles will be removed.^(If it's reported!) *(‘Has anyone felt this?’ ‘First day on Adderall’)*   **Do not title your post with DAE.** People with ADHD always have.  Ask a specific question in the title and ask at least two specific questions in your post. There is *ALWAYS* space.  \n4. **Meme/comic/picture/video** - With a visual post, use a descriptive title, and also include a comment asking a question for discussion or share your own experience....
