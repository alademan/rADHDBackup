# New /r/ADHD posting rules!

1. **[Read the FAQ](http://code.reddit.com/wiki/help/faqs/ADHD)** at least once before posting! If something is missing you can add it yourself.

2. **[Search /r/adhd](http://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/search?q=adhd+keywords&restrict_sr=on) for previous posts** on the topic ([search via google](http://www.google.com/search?q=site:reddit.com%2Fr%2Fadhd+adderall)).  

3. **Use a specific, meaningful title.** Incomplete or vague post titles will be removed.  *(‘Has anyone felt this?’ ‘First day on Adderall’ )*   **Do not title your post with DAE.**  Odds are people have.  Ask specific question in the title and ask at least two specific questions in your post. There is ALWAYS space.

4. **Meme/comics/picture** - When posting a picture or a meme, post a comment asking a question for discussion or share your own experience...otherwise post in [/r/adhdmeme](http://www.reddit.com/r/adhdmeme).

5. **No posts asking about drug side effects** - Search google or ask in the weekly medication thread. (Reasoning in upcoming posting FAQ.)  
    
6. **AMA’s and surveys require prior mod approval.**
